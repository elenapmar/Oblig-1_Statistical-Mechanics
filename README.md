# Oblig-1_Statistical-Mechanics

During the third year of my degree, I coursed a subject about statistical mechanics and we had to hand-in two little projects with several exercises in each of them in order to do the final exam. In this project I only needed to code in one of the sections of one of the exercises. All of this code is in the file "Section b.py". If you execute it you should obtain all the plots contained in the folder "Plots".
